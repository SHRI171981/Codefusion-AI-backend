- **Code Execution**: Docker containers for secure code execution
- **Authentication**: JWT authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (for code execution environment)
- Virtual environment tool (venv or conda)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kartikeyapandey20/Codefusion-AI-backend.git
cd Codefusion-AI-backend
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your database credentials and other configuration
```

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`


## API Documentation

FastAPI provides automatic interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. After starting the server, visit:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Alternative documentation: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest
```
